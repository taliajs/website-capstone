### Security

Please note that [all pages hosted via GitHub Pages are public on the internet](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), even if the repository is **private**!!

However, there are few steps you can take to reduce the chance of your blog post going viral. 
Please note that these are [security by obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) techniques that are NOT robust. 

1. Put it on the [deep web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web). Most search engines *crawl* the web. If there are no links to a URL, then crawlers will never find it. Just don't link to your blog post **anywhere**. [Note: it's possible that the GitHub Pages service might index all pages. ]
1. You can at least make the URL harder to remember or copy-and-paste by pading the name with a random MD5 hash. 

```{r}
obscure_filename <- paste0(
  "post_",
  digest::digest(runif(1), algo = "md5"),
  ".Rmd"
)
obscure_filename
```

## Consider adding your resume

You might consider writing your resume in **pagedown** and adding it to your website.
